My grid search shows C=10 as being the best parameters; my log loss and accuracy plots prove this to be true, where any c value greater than -2 performing well with little improvements as c increases. If my model was performing better, I would look into removing features, but there aren't a surplus of features that would drive up execution costs, so they can remain."
