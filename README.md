# Define and Solve a Machine Learning Problem

This project demonstrates how to define, prepare, and solve a machine learning problem using Python. It consists of the full ML pipeline, including:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature selection
- Model training and evaluation

My machine learning model predicts an individual's binary income class using a custom trained linear regression model.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. Open `DefineAndSolveMLProblem.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run through the cells to follow the ML workflow
